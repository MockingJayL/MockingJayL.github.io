               ‚ÄúMore‚Äù compiler is an interactive audio-visual sequencer that offers players to manipulate each track‚Äôs musical elements. Most stream music apps provide a passive music-listening experience for the audiences, but the ‚Äúfun‚Äù part of music is about engagement. This project aims to take ‚Äúaudience‚Äù as ‚Äúparticipants‚Äù into a music-listening experience, where players can control the volume of each track(vocals, beats, pads, ambiance sound), change the background image of the music player, and the patterns types of beats, pads, and ambiance sound. We chose ‚ÄúMore‚Äù as music material and hope people can feel more in this interactive audio-visual sequencer.

            <p class="descricao-delay">
            To enable players to enjoy the "fun" of music-making process, "More" Complier wants to deliver the basic music production concept that published music is mixed with different tracks, such as vocals, pianos, pads, beats, ambiance sound, etc. In this application, we offer players the opportunities to control the volume of each track(vocals, beats, pads, ambiance sound), the pattern of drums, and the types of ambiance sound. The right figure shows the UI of the application. There are five tracks and bass/effect tracks have several options to choose. <br></br>

            Since the original version of <a style = "color:white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VTkBuxU4yk">"More"</a> is a Dance/EDM music, we want to create a cool audio-visualizer effect. We map the volume of the music with the intensity of the bloom intensity of the "KDA" text, so that when the music hit in the beat, the "KDA" text will shine. The video shown in the right demonstrates the effect of real-time audio-visualizer effect. <br></br>

              The first step is ideation, where I took time to think about what functionalities and features should be included, and what user experience should be like. With the goal of making people who don‚Äôt have professional music training have opportunities to experience a playful music-making process, <br>I decided to allow players manipulating the sound tracks.

            <h4 class="titulo-delay">UI design</h4>
            <p class="descricao-delay">
              Before actually designing the UI, I sketched some drafts about the layout of the application. What I can confirm is that there should be five sliders to control the volume of each track; each track should have buttons to choose the sample sound; audio-visualizer is needed for creating a cool vibe.

             Since the application needs to provide players with full control of each track, I need to seperate or made music<br>asset for each track.  Logic Pro as the tool to make the audio/music assets for this project.

            <p class="descricao-delay">
            I did a preliminary user study, where I invited 10 of my friends to play with "More" Compiler. Most of they gave positive feedback and they stated that it is super fun to have more control of each track when listening to the music. I do believe that "interactive music experience" will be the trend in the future, since more engagement provides more engagement and give better music experience. <br></br> Through this project, the users can have a clear vision about how songs are composed because they can listen to different tracks separately, and then listen to all of them as a whole. However, this project mainly focused on recomposing "MORE", but not remixing it. In the future, we can try to remix the song by producing and creating different types of beats, changing the song to different speeds, and working out more suitable background music to suit the lyrics.
